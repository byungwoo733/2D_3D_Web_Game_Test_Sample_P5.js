# 2D_3D_Web_Game_Test_Sample_P5.js
2D Game / 3D WebGL Game Test Samples Source based in P5.js 

Specially, I`m trying to study individual 3D WebGL Game Development based in P5.js
This is the only Samples & Demo

Sample Example Templates for P5.js WebGL Game Development 
(Texture, Stages, Particles, Gravity, Collision)

Unfortunately, I guess it doesn`t support to 3D Rigged Character (.fbx)
(Only support .obj & .stl P5.js)
